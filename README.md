# Nommy

## Project Overview

Nommy is a meal planning app that is designed to help users decide on what to cook! A lot of people would agree that deciding on what to cook on a given night can take up time and effort but Nommy is here to help you make your decision.

The app is essentially a database of recipes that also allows users to add their own recipes to those already on the site. Additional functionality is also here allowing users to create profiles, share and bookmark recipes, basically giving them a virtual cookbook!

## User Experience (UX)

### User Stories

#### Epic - User Navigation
- As a first time user of the site, I want to immediately understand the content of the site and decide if it suits my needs.
- As a site user, I want the app layout in a way that allows me to navigate intuitively, through well designed navigation bars and page content.
- As a site user, I want to view a paginated list of recipes, so I can decide on which one to view.
- As a site user, I want to be able to click on a recipe to view the ingredients, cook time and method of cooking.
- As a site user, I want to be able to view the number of likes on each recipe so that I can see which is the most popular.
- As a site user, I want to be able to view and share receipes with my friends.

#### Epic - User Profile
- As a site user, I want to be able to create my own account so I can create my own recipes, save existing recipes as favourites and comment/like other users recipes.
- As a registered site user, I want to be able to log in and log out of my account safely and securely.
- As a site user, I want to be able to view my statistics such as how many recipes I've added, how many I have in my favourites and how many recipes I've commented on.

#### Epic - Recipe Interaction
- As a registered user, I want to be able to add recipes to my favourites list so I can find them easily in future.
- As a registered user, I want to be able to create my own recipes to add to the app.
- As a registered user, I want to be able to edit recipes I have created, for example to add tips, or make other changes.
- As a registered user, I want to be able to view my favourite recipes in one location.
- As a registered user, I want to be able to view the recipes I have created in one location.

## Features

## Agile Methodology

The agile methodology was used in developing this project through Github projects. 

The 3 user story epics above were broken down into Milestones on the Github project and each user story in the given Milestone was further broken down into individual issues to facilitate completion of each user story.

Please view the Github projects board [here](https://github.com/users/StephenB92/projects/4).

## Data Models

Custom models are used throughout the project.

To facilitate users creating their own recipes, a custom recipe model is required.

To facilitate users commenting on recipes, a custom comment model is required.

To facilitate users creating their own profiles, a custom user profile model is required.

You can view the details of the database schema [here](documentation/database-schema/database-schema.png).
